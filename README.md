# Semantic HTML Examples

This repository demonstrates the difference between **non-semantic** and **semantic** HTML. It supports the blog post: [Semantic HTML for SEO and Accessibility](link-to-your-blog).

## Files
- `before.html` → Example using only <div> and <span>
- `after.html` → Same page rewritten with semantic tags
- `index.html` → Full semantic blog page

## Benefits
- Better SEO (search engine crawling, indexing)
- Better accessibility (screen reader support, ARIA landmarks)
- Cleaner, maintainable code

## Testing
1. Open files in browser
2. Run through [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
3. Use Lighthouse to measure accessibility and SEO improvements# semantic-html-examples
